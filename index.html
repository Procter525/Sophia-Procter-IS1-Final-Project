	<h1>Procter Equipment Library</h1>
	<p>The Procter Equipment Library is a documentation of equipment owned by Sophia Procter. This equipment gets used by many different people for many different events and since there is so much of it to keep track of, this website has been created. This website is a directory of where all the equipment belongs and documentation of the events that they have been used for in the past. Hopefully, this will help people who borrow and help transport the equipment with putting everything back where it belongs and keeping track of which items belong to Procter to begin with (as opposed to equipment borrowed from other entities and people).</p>
